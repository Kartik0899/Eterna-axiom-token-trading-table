Frontend Task - Token Trading Table
Build a pixel-perfect replica of Axiom Trade's token discovery table with these requirements:
( https://axiom.trade/pulse )

Core Features:
1. All token columns(New pairs, Final Stretch, Migrated)
2. Implement variety: popover, tooltip, modal, sorting
3. Different interaction patterns: hover effects, click actions
4. Real-time price updates (WebSocket mock) with smooth color transitions
5. Loading states: skeleton, shimmer, progressive loading, error boundaries
6. Pixel-perfect visual match to website (≤ 2 px diff verified with a visual-regression tool)


Technical Requirements:
1. Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS
2. Redux Toolkit for complex state, React Query for data fetching
3. UI - shadcn/ui for accessible components
4. Performance: memoized components, no layout shifts, <100ms interactions
5. Atomic Architecture: reusable components, custom hooks, shared utilities, DRY principles
6. Code quality: comprehensive typing, error handling, documented complex logic (bonus)
7. Must score ≥ 90 on Lighthouse (mobile & desktop) 


Evaluation: Performance optimization (35%), Code structure/reusability (30%), Pixel-perfect UI (25%), Feature completeness (10%)

Note: Prioritize smooth performance and clean, reusable code architecture. Every component should be built for reuse across the application.
